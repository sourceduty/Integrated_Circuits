The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol plays a crucial role in defining the boundaries and constraints within which sensor technologies can operate. The inherent limitations of UART, such as its relatively low data transfer rates compared to more advanced communication protocols like SPI or I2C, have made it challenging for developers to push the boundaries of innovation in sensor technology. As we continue to explore new frontiers in sensing applications, the need for faster and more efficient communication methods becomes increasingly apparent. However, due to the widespread adoption of UART as a standard interface for many sensors and modules, there is often limited incentive for manufacturers to invest heavily in developing entirely new sensor technologies that would require significant changes to existing systems. This creates a somewhat stagnant environment where incremental improvements are made rather than groundbreaking advancements. Furthermore, the finite number of physical quantities that can be measured by sensors adds another layer of constraint on innovation. As we have already developed highly sensitive and accurate sensors for most fundamental parameters such as temperature, pressure, acceleration, and light intensity, finding new or novel things to measure becomes increasingly difficult. This leads to a situation where sensor technology development is often focused on improving the performance of existing sensors rather than exploring entirely new sensing modalities. Consequently, while UART continues to serve its purpose in enabling communication between microcontrollers and various sensor modules, it also acts as a limiting factor that hinders rapid progress and innovation within the field of sensor technologies.

Innovation in integrated circuits (ICs) and electronics has increasingly become constrained by a focus on incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking advancements. Much of the current progress revolves around refining existing technologies—making processors slightly faster, reducing power consumption marginally, or enhancing sensor sensitivity within known physical limits. A key limiting factor is the finite set of measurable physical quantities; most fundamental parameters like temperature, pressure, acceleration, and light intensity already have highly sensitive and accurate sensors. As a result, the development of sensor technology tends to prioritize optimization over novelty, limiting the potential for radical innovation. With fewer unexplored sensing modalities available, the electronics industry faces a bottleneck where the scope for transformative breakthroughs becomes increasingly narrow.

Whether programming is easier than electrical engineering depends on the individual's background, interests, and cognitive strengths, but generally, many people perceive programming as more accessible due to its lower barrier to entry and the abundance of learning resources available online. Programming often involves logical thinking, problem-solving, and working with abstract data structures, which can be learned incrementally through hands-on practice with minimal equipment—just a computer and the right software. In contrast, electrical engineering typically requires a deeper understanding of physical laws, such as electromagnetism and circuit theory, as well as practical knowledge of hardware systems, which can be more complex and less forgiving in terms of experimentation and troubleshooting. Additionally, electrical engineering often necessitates expensive lab equipment, safety considerations, and a solid grasp of advanced mathematics, making it more daunting for beginners. However, both fields are intellectually demanding in their own ways, and mastering either one requires dedication, curiosity, and time; the perception of difficulty often comes down to personal preference and the context in which the subject is being studied.
